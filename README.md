# Basic_Onshape_CAD
Onshape CAD for Engineering 4

## Part 1 - Base

### Description
I had trouble understanding the way sketches and dimensions worked within Onshape, but as I continued the part I started to get the hang of dimensions. Without the video Dr. Shields provided I probably wouldve taken much more time to finish this piece.

## Part 2 - Mount

### Description
As this one was very similar to make like the last one, it was easier for me to go through the motions of where to find the different tools to dimension and constrain the part. The video was helpful and watching him make it 3 different ways really showed the longevity of Onshape and how much different it is than Solidworks.

## Part 3 - Fork

### Description
Last year I had the most trouble making this part when doing this assembly, but that was not the case this year. I knocked this out in about 15 minutes and it baffled me how fast and easy Onshape makes some of the tools. The craziest part for me was doing Fillets and since it has Tangent Propagation, I only had to select 5 lines total and the whole thing was filleted. Last year you would have to select 10 or 15.
